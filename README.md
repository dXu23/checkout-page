## Overview

![screenshot](./checkout.png)

Introduce your projects by taking a screenshot or a gif. Try to tell visitors a story about your project by answering:

- Where can I see your demo?
Right [here](https://cheery-moonbeam-5e59de.netlify.app/)

- What was your experience?

I didn't really like the project because I wasted too much time
trying to find a way to style the buttons on input[type=number],
when there exists no such method.

- What have you learned/improved?

I learned how to use Google Material Icons.

- Your wisdom? :)

Sometimes, you have to learn to discard the browser's native functionality such
as the up and down buttons on inputs and create your own up and down buttons to
achieve the look and functionality you need.
